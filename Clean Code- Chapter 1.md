## Clean Code: Chapter 1

* ...specifying requirements in such detail that a machine can execute them is _programming_. Such a specification _is_ code.
* Good code _matters_ because we've had to deal with lacking code for so long.
* Wading: '...Slog through a morass of tangled brambles and hidden pitfalls..." of bad code
* LeBlancâ€™s law: Later equals never when "I'll fix this code _later_"
* Keeping your code clean is a "matter of personal survival".
* We share the blame for bad code because we contribute to the problem, not enough time, not enough resources because stakeholders, users, and managers are looking at developers to tell them what we think, even if they don't like the truth.
* Managers may defend the schedule and requirements with passion because it is there job. It is *our* job to defend the code with equal passion.
* It is unprofessional of programmers to give in to unrealistic deadlines or requirements of managers who don't understand the risks of making messes out of a code base. See Leblan's Law.
* "code sense" the ability to recognize why code is bad and how to make it clean(er)
* What is Clean Code? elegeant, efficient, pleasing, focused
* Bad code tries to do too much
* Our code should be "matter of fact" instead of "speculative"
* Clean Code should only contain what is necessary, giving the perception of decisiveness.
* "Clean code always looks like it was written by someone who cares." - Michael Feathers, author of Working
Effectively with Legacy Code
* Clean Code is "...Pretty much what you expected"
